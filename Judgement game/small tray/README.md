# Measuring stick set (small)
This set is intended to be cut from Proofgrade 12x6” sheets of hardwood, plus a top layer of cast acrylic. Each layer is approximately 1/8” thick. Measurements in illustrator were built at exact scale, then offset by `0.0035` for kerf. Magnet holes were inset by `–0.002` for a tight friction fit.


### Materials
	* 1 sheet Proofgrade Medium Cherry Hardwood (Finished)
	* 1 sheet Proofgrade Medium Walnut Hardwood (Finished)
	* 1 sheet 1/8” clear acrylic
	*  [1/8” diameter magnets](https://www.kjmagnetics.com/proddetail.asp?prod=D22-N52)


### Bottom layer
	1. Proofgrade settings for Medium Cherry
		* CUT:
			* Speed: `189`
			* Power: `FULL`
			* # of Passes: `1`
			* Focus Height: `0.118`
	2. One print:
		1. CUT the magnet holes first
		2. CUT the outline last


### Mid layer
	1. Proofgrade settings for Medium Walnut
 		* SCORE:
			* Speed: `125`
			* Power: `11`
			* # of Passes: `1`
			* Focus Height: `0.118`
		* CUT:
			* Speed: `189`
			* Power: `FULL`
			* # of Passes: `1`
			* Focus Height: `0.118`
	2. First print:
		1. SCORE the numbers on the 1x2x3x5 widget
		2. SCORE the numbers on the measuring widgets
		3. CUT the outlines of the measuring widgets
		4. IGNORE all other layers
	3. Carefully flip over each measuring stick without moving the rest of the sheet.
	4. Second print:
		1. SCORE the numbers on the measuring widgets (back side)
		2. CUT the magnet holes
		3. CUT the outline of the layer
		4. IGNORE all other layers


### Top layer
	1. Proofgrade settings for Medium Clear Acrylic
		* CUT:
			* Speed: `157`
			* Power: `FULL`
			* # of Passes: `1`
			* Focus Height: `0.118`
	2. One print:
		1. CUT the magnet holes
		2. CUT the outline


### Assembly
	1. Superglue magnets into the holes on each layer ([thinner discs](https://www.kjmagnetics.com/proddetail.asp?prod=D201-N52) can be stacked to get the layer height exact)
	2. Remove contact paper


### Notes
	* I left one corner un-magnetized, which makes it easier to open the finished tray. This works well, but I might add another magnet joint in the middle of the tray, between the bottom and mid layers, to fight against warping in the middle layer.
