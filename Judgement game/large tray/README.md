# Measuring stick set (large)
This tray is designed to be made from FOUR full sheets of 12x20" Proofgrade material. Recommend medium cherry for the bottom, medium walnut for the token layer, and two sheets of medium acrylic for the topper and optional tournament tray layer.

This tray is intended to fit inside a [Battlefoam Warmachine bag](https://us.battlefoam.com/warmachine-bag/) (8.5”x15.5”). Each layer is approximately 1/8” thick. Measurements in Illustrator were built at exact scale, then offset by `0.0035` for kerf. Magnet holes were inset by `–0.002` for a tight friction fit. Tournament tray cutouts are `51mm` in diameter.

### Notes
  * Keep the masking paper on until the magnets are glued in place to catch any extra glue.
  * The acrylic layers can fog if exposed to the superglue while it's off-gassing, so I try to glue the magnets in, wait a minute or two before peeling off the contact paper, and then keep the layers separate overnight to let everything cure with good ventilation.
  * The faster/hotter engrave (500x45) on Walnut Ply came out nice and deep. It could go lighter in the future.
