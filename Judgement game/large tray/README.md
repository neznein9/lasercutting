# Measuring stick set (large)
## Work in Progress
These files haven’t been printed yet and may need adjustments. Cutting and assembly should follow the same process as my [smaller tray](../small%20tray/README.md).

---

This set is intended to be cut from Proofgrade 12x20” sheets of plywood, plus a top layer of cast acrylic. This tray is intended to fit inside a [Battlefoam Warmachine bag](https://us.battlefoam.com/warmachine-bag/) (8.5”x15.5”).

Each layer is approximately 1/8” thick. Measurements in Illustrator were built at exact scale, then offset by `0.0035` for kerf. Magnet holes were inset by `–0.002` for a tight friction fit.

### Materials
  * 1 sheet Proofgrade Medium Cherry Plywood (Finished)
  * 1 sheet Proofgrade Medium Walnut Plywood (Finished)
  * 1 sheet 1/8” clear acrylic
  *  [1/8” diameter magnets](https://www.kjmagnetics.com/proddetail.asp?prod=D22-N52)


### Notes
  * Illustrator notes for rectangular measuring sticks
      1. Corners are rounded to `0.05`
  * Illustrator notes for the 50mm base steppers
      1. Create a circle 50mm in diameter
      2. Duplicate and offset by 1-3 inches
      3. Pathfinder/boolean ops to split the overlapping shapes apart
      4. The sharp corners on the outside of the shape are rounded to `0.075`
      5. Internal cutouts are offset by `–0.3`
      6. Internal cutout sharp corners are rounded to `0.065`
      7. Concave corners where circles meet are rounded to `0.25`
