# Measuring stick set (large)
## Work in Progress
These files haven’t been printed yet and may need adjustments. Cutting and assembly should follow the same process as my smaller tray.

---

This set is intended to be cut from Proofgrade 12x20” sheets of plywood, plus a top layer of cast acrylic. This tray is intended to fit inside a [Battlefoam Warmachine bag](https://us.battlefoam.com/warmachine-bag/) (8.5”x15.5”).

Each layer is approximately 1/8” thick. Measurements in Illustrator were built at exact scale, then offset by `0.0035` for kerf. Magnet holes were inset by `–0.002` for a tight friction fit.
