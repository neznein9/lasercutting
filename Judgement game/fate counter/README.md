    2. First print:
        1. ENGRAVE the text first
        2. CUT the magnet holes
        3. CUT the outline last
        4. IGNORE the text for the back
    3. Second print:
        1. Carefully flip the piece, without moving the board.
        2. ENGRAVE the text
        3. IGNORE the other layers

### Notes
    *  Forgot to adjust the magnet holes for kerf so they are a bit loose. Supergluing them into the holes resulted in a less-than-flush surface so the dial catches the edges of the magnets in some spots. The whole thing could be scaled down a bit. Text on the underneath can go smaller. I scaled up the middle two magnets but forgot to scale up the corresponding holes on the arrows so the rotation is a little rough. Should also upgrade the magnets holding the rim on.
    * What if we used a sphere magnet on the underside of the arrows?
