# Measuring stick set (small)
This set is intended to be cut from Proofgrade 12x6” sheets of hardwood, plus a top layer of cast acrylic. Each layer is approximately 1/8” thick. Measurements in illustrator were built at exact scale, then offset by `0.0035` for kerf. Magnet holes were inset by `–0.002` for a tight friction fit.

### Materials
  * 1 sheet Proofgrade Medium Cherry Hardwood (Finished)
  * 1 sheet Proofgrade Medium Walnut Hardwood (Finished)
  * 1 sheet 1/8” clear acrylic
  *  [3/16” diameter magnets](https://www.kjmagnetics.com/proddetail.asp?prod=D31-N52)


### Bottom layer
  1. Proofgrade settings for Medium Cherry
      * CUT:
        * Speed: `189`
        * Power: `FULL`
        * \# of Passes: `1`
        * Focus Height: `auto`
      * ENGRAVE: (NOT proofgrade settings)
        * Speed: `500`
        * Power: `30`
        * Lines per inch: `340`
        * \# of Passes: `1`
        * Focus Height: `0.125`
  2. One print:
      1. ENGRAVE the text
      2. CUT the magnet holes first
      3. CUT the outline last


### Mid layer
  1. Proofgrade settings for Medium Walnut
      * CUT:
        * Speed: `189`
        * Power: `FULL`
        * \# of Passes: `1`
        * Focus Height: `0.118`
  2. First print:
        1. CUT the outlines of the measuring widgets
        2. CUT the magnet holes
        3. CUT the outline of the punchout
        4. CUT the outline of the tray
  4. Second print:
        1. CUT the magnet holes
        2. CUT the outline of the layer


### Top layer
  1. Proofgrade settings for Medium Clear Acrylic
      * CUT:
        * Speed: `157`
        * Power: `FULL`
        * \# of Passes: `1`
        * Focus Height: `0.118`
  2. One print:
        1. CUT the magnet holes
        2. CUT the outline


### Assembly
  1. Superglue magnets into the holes on each layer ([thinner discs](https://www.kjmagnetics.com/proddetail.asp?prod=D31-N52) can be stacked to get the layer height exact)
  2. Remove contact paper


### Notes
  * First test came out very light so I bumped up the engrave power.
